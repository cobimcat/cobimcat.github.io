## features
- Parametric design tool based on [CSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry).
- Supported primitives: solids, profiles (2d shapes) and cords (3d polylines).
- Profile/cord creation and editing.
- Extrusion and revolution of profiles to create solids.
- Union, intersection and subtraction of solids.
- Object transformation (translation, rotation, scale).
- Definition of formulas for object property values.
- Measuring tools (length, angle, area and volume).
- Orbit-Pan-Zoom tool.
- Fly tool (with collision detection and ground distance control).
- Multiple selection of objects.
- Face selection tool.
- Editing of model structure and object properties.
- Dynamic sectioning of models.
- Realistic shading: shadow casting and ambient occlusion.
- Solar simulation tool.
- Vertex, egde and face snapping in the drawing, measurement and transformation tools.
- Scripting tool (using javascript language).
- Reporting tool to check conditions on the model objects (supported reporting formats: BRS and [IDS](https://www.buildingsmart.org/what-is-information-delivery-specification-ids/)).
- Object controllers (a Controller is a program that changes the state of an object when a certain event occurs).
- BIM Inventory tool to list the IFC types, classifications, groups and layers of the model.
- BIM Layout tool to visualize the interior layout of the building.
- BIM Inspector tool to inspect the IFC entities of the model.
- BIM Delta tool to detect changes between two versions of an IFC file.
- Search tool to find model properties by name or by value.
- Histogram tool to visualize the distribution of values ​​for a given property.
- Multiple file storage systems are supported: webdav server, local file system and IndexedDB.
- Load/Export IFC models. Support for multiple IFC schemas (IFC2X3, IFC4 and IFC4X3_ADD2).
- Load/Export models in BRF format (JSON BimRocket format).
- Load/Export models in STL, GLB, Wavefront OBJ and Collada formats.
